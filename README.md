- String calculator challenge

Write a program which takes a string of user input and treats it as a mathematical calculation, reporting the result of the calculation to the user.

Support addition, subtraction, multiplication and division represented by “+”, “-“, “*”, and “/”
Unrecognised numbers should result in an error being reported to the user, indicating the string which was not recognised

- Use this file of common words to write a program to find anagrams of words entered by a user.

e.g.
$ python3 anagrammer.py
Enter a word: race

Anagrams of 'race' are:
acer
care
